A collection of tools to write cleaner and shorter code.

## `spread!`

An extension of the spread/struct update syntax that allow taking fields from different type
structs, as long as the listed fields have the same type in both structs. It supports modifier
prefixes allowing to perform common transformations, such as cloning, converting or taking a
reference.

## `anon!`

Generate a value of an anonymous struct with provided fields whose types are inferred. Can be used
to bundle many variables in a single struct to then be used in `spread!`. It supports the same
features as `spread!` (lists and modifiers) except for the final struct update syntax.

## `slet!`

Avoids having to write a lot of transforations like `let variable_with_long_name =
variable_with_long_name.clone()` (which is common in async code) by listing all the identifiers and
transformations with the same syntax as `anon!`. In additation, each field name can be prefixed by
`mut` (before a potential modifier) to make a `let mut` binding.

## `fn_struct!`

Generates a struct representing the arguments of a given function or method, allowing to use
Rust's struct update syntax, `spread!` and `Default` with function arguments.
The fields listed can use modifiers from `spread!` like `&`, which allows for exemple to call
functions with reference arguments using a struct without references, which can thus implement
`Default`. The struct can be generic over the types of the function arguments, while the `call`
function can also be generic over types not appearing in the arguments.

It is targeted to be used when writing tests in which a function with many parameters is called
often and for which repeated arguments can be applied using `spread!`.

## `default`

Turbofish variant of `Default::default()`, mostly to use with struct update syntax or `spread!`.

## Features

- `serde_derive`: structs generated by `anon!` will implement `Serialize`
<!-- - `similar-asserts`: `assert_fields_eq!` will use `similar_asserts::assert_eq!` instead of
  `core::assert_eq!`, which provides a pretty diff output. -->
